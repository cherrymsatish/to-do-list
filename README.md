To-Do List App
This is a simple command-line to-do list application implemented in Python. It allows you to manage your tasks by adding, viewing, marking as complete, and deleting them. Tasks are organized by name, priority, due date, and status.

Features
Add Task: You can add a new task to the to-do list by providing the task name, priority (High, Medium, Low), and due date.

View Task: You can view the list of tasks, including their serial number, task name, task priority, due date, and status. Status indicates whether the task has been marked as complete or not.

Mark Task as Complete: You can mark a task as complete by selecting it from the list and changing its status to "Yes."

Delete Task: You can delete a task by selecting it from the list, and the task will be removed from the to-do list.
